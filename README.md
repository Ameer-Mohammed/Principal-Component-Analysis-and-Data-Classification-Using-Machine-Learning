# Principal Component Analysis and Data Classification Using Machine Learning
 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and machine learning techniques for data classification. The project focuses on analyzing and classifying a dataset related to date fruits.

## Main Function 
+ Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the data  
+ Implemented various machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees (DT) to classify the date fruit dataset  
+ Evaluated the performance of the machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
+ Visualized the results of the PCA and the classification models  

## Tech Stack
+ Python
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
+ Pandas (for data manipulation)
+ Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
